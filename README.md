## 📖 Project Description

🚀 I created this **personal portfolio website** using **React**, **Vite**, **HTML**, **CSS**, and **EmailJS** to showcase my work, skills, and achievements in a modern and interactive format.

The portfolio includes several dedicated sections:

- 👨‍💻 **About Me** – A brief introduction and background.
- 🛠️ **Skills** – Technologies and tools I’ve worked with.
- 💼 **Projects** – Key projects with descriptions, tech stacks, and links to live demos and repositories.
- 📜 **Certifications** – Verified certificates from platforms like NPTEL, Coursera, HackerRank, and more.
- ✉️ **Contact** – A fully functional contact form integrated with **EmailJS**, allowing visitors to send messages directly to my email.

📱 The site is fully responsive, fast, and designed to create a lasting impression for recruiters, collaborators, and anyone interested in my work.
